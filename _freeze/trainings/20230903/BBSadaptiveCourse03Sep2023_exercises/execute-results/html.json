Solutions to the exercises will also be available through that webpage after the course. \n\n# Getting started {-}\n\n- Make sure that you have the latest version of `rpact` installed.\n- Download the raw R markdown exercise file by clicking on the \"code\" block of the right upper corner [here](https://baselbiometrics.github.io/home/docs/trainings/20230903/BBSadaptiveCourse03Sep2023_exercises.html).\n- Start up your local Rstudio installation. Then open the R markdown exercise file.\n- Start answering the questions below by adding text or your own `R` code to the R markdown file. Use the `rpact` help for guidance.\n\n$\\Rightarrow$ **Good Luck!**\n\n# Load `rpact` {-}\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Load rpact\nlibrary(rpact)\npackageVersion(\"rpact\") # version should be version 3.0 or higher\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] '3.4.0'\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n# Exercise 1 (Group-sequential survival trial with efficacy and futility interim analyses) {-}\n\nAssume we plan a phase III, randomized, multicenter, open-label, two-arm trial with a time-to-event endpoint of OS. The **general assumptions for the sample size assessment** are:\n\n- 2:1 randomization.\n- Uniform recruitment of 480 patients over 10 months (48 per month). \n- The dropout rate is 5% in both arms over 12 months.\n\nThe **sample size section for OS** states that the following additional assumptions were made:\n\n- Exponentially distributed OS in the control arm with a median of 12 months.\n- Median OS improvement vs. control of 4.9 months (medians 16.9 vs. 12 months, i.e. a HR of approximately 0.71).\n- Log-rank test at a two-sided significance level of 0.05, power 80%.\n- One interim analyses for efficacy (IA) and one final analysis using the O\\'Brien-Fleming boundaries approximated using the Lan-DeMets method. The first IA will be performed after 60% of information. \n\n## Exercise 1a (Sample size calculation) {-}\n\nCalculate the required number of events and timing of analysis for OS using the information fraction of 60%.

More precisely, we implement an interim analysis using the inverse normal method, with the following characteristics (all with respect to the primary endpoint):\n\n- Stop for futility if the investigational drug appears worse than Placebo\n\n- Stop for efficacy if the investigational drug appears \"very significantly better\" than Placebo ($p < 0.0001$)\n\nWhich set of $(\\alpha,\\alpha_0,\\alpha_1,\\alpha_2)$ satisfies these conditions?\n\nHint: Use `getDesignInverseNormal` with a user-defined alpha-spending function and a binding futility boundary.\n\n**Solution:** \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# type solution here\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n**What regulatory issues could this raise?**\n\n**Solution**\n\n\n## Exercise 2b (early stopping and sample size adaptation) {-}\n\n 1.

Should we stop or continue the trial?\n\nHint: `getDataset` to define the input dataset and `getAnalysisResults` to analyse it.\n\n**Solution**\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# type solution here\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n 2. At the same time, there is a change in strategy, and we now want 90% power at an improvement of 4 points over placebo. Determine the sample size per treatment group for the second stage of the trial, in light of the interim results.\n\nHint: Calculate second stage sample size using `getSampleSizeMeans` with type I error equal to the conditional rejection probability from the previous part.\n\n**Solution**\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# type solution here\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n## Exercise 2c (final inference) {-}\n\nIn the second stage of the trial, we observe an average ADAS-Cog improvement of only **3 points** under the investigational drug and of 1 point under Placebo.\n\n 1.

O'Brien-Fleming boundaries should be used with one-sided $\\alpha = 0.025$ and non-binding futility bounds 0 and 0.5 for the first and the second stage, respectively, on the z-value scale.\n\nThe endpoints are binary (failure rates) and should be compared in a parallel group design, i.e., the null hypothesis to be tested is\n$H_0:\\pi_1 - \\pi_2 = 0\\,,$ which is tested against the alternative $H_1: \\pi_1 - \\pi_2 < 0\\,.$\n\n## Exercise 3a (sample size calculation) {-}\n\nWhat is the necessary sample size to achieve 90% power if the failure rates are assumed to be $\\pi_1 = 0.40$ and $\\pi_2 = 0.60$?
