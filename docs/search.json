What path one can follow to create statistical innovations for detection or diagnosis of cancer? What are the interesting milestones already achieved in this direction and what are the possible directions of work for the future?\n\n\nChristian\nKuhl\nHow to improve cooperation and motivate Clinicians to walk beside the standard way?\n\n\nDivya\nGunasekar\nAt times when there is so much competition, how can we reduce the time to get a novel product to market sooner?\n\n\nEmmanuel\nZuber\nHow to avoid the double trap of 1) falling in love with your innovation and 2) losing the passion for the adequate solution to the real problem ?\n\n\nFederico\nMattiello\nWhat are the catalysts that help bringing innovation to fruition?\n\n\nJacob\nStærk-Østergaard\nCan we improve collaboration across industry and academia to push novel statistical methods into acceptance from both regulators and clinicians, and if so how?\n\n\nJenny\nDevenport\nThe agenda looks very good and emphasizes getting clinicians / nonstatisticians excited. While indeed a formidable challenge in the route to change, we also experience headwinds from our own function–who perhaps struggle to separate seizing opportunities with debating enhancements. In other words, how can we do a better job as statisticians to show up as a united front so that our clinicians don’t see methods as simply a matter of opinion?\n\n\nJonas\nLindeløv\n(1) Do you have examples of important innovations that did not reach impact? Can we draw learnings from those examples? (2) What is the effect size of following all the recommendations from this session? For example, is it an increase from 10% probability of success to 25%?\n\n\nJuergen\nScheuenpflug\nIn which phase of drug development do you see the greatest need to innovate (e.g. FiH to PoC or PoC - MAA/ LCM? What are the most important barriers which prevent successful innovation and how to mitigate these?\n\n\nLada\nMitchell\n1. Good statistical thinking, AI and maschine learning-what is a magical formula and long term vision? 2. How to inluence faster, eg bring new meaningful stats methodoly to applicatons and use?\n\n\nLiliya\nChamitava\nHow can we measure the success or impact of a statistical innovation once it has been implemented into a practice?\n\n\nLinard\nHoessly\nHow do you deal with the subjectivity on methodological questions in many statistical areas?\n\n\nNina\nHeiss\nWhich policy challenge would you recommend focussing on.\n\n\nPernille\nJuul Jørgensen\nQ1.1: How to balance adoptations of new statistical methods with the need for fast developed clinical programmes? Q1.2: Are there sometimes you would advise to go with an “old” method instead of trying something “new” out? Q2: How much extra time do you estimate that it takes to implement a new method for a study design? Q3: Is there a regulatory risk (e.g. longer interactions or pushback?) when using a new statistical method?\n\n\nStefan\nEnglert\nWhat measures do you take to quantify and measure impact? Which metrics are used?\n\n\nStefan\nSchandelmaier\nHello Panel. Thanks for the seminar! We (Malena Chiaborelli, Stefan Schandelmaier) are establishing a group for methods implementation at the University of Basel. We will initially focus on “written methods guidance” which we believe plays a key role in the innovation to implementation process. We would be very interested in ideas on how we can improve methods guidance to maximise its usefulness and impact.\n\n\nSusan\nEdwards\nHow do you know when a new innovation’s benefit is great enough to make up for its (likely) added complexity or at least the hurdle of its unfamiliarity?\n\n\nTu\nXu\nThe biologic innovation is of no doubt to be a must in industry environment. However, statistical innovation is often considered an optional or ‘nice-to-have’ as long as regulatory requirements are met. How could we raise the importance of statistical innovation to the business and make it as a necessary part of clinical development process?\n\n\nXiaoling\nWu\nwhat is the one task statistician can do better than AI?\n\n\nXiaowei\nRen\nIs there any application of Bayesian sample size augment in the single arm trial\n\n\nYanning\nLiu\nNA\n\n\nYingwen\nDong\nWhat’s the biggest hurdle to introduce innovation in clinical development and how to overcome it?"

The second stage of the trial, showing less of a treatment effect, carries greater weight in this “naive” (that is, incorrect) version of the test. Note that it can go both ways: in other examples, the adaptive (correct) version of the test may be the one that fails to reject the null hypothesis. In less borderline situations, both tests will lead to the same conclusion. Proposals have been made in the literature for dealing with borderline situations."

The second stage of the trial, showing less of a treatment effect, carries greater weight in this “naive” (that is, incorrect) version of the test. Note that it can go both ways: in other examples, the adaptive (correct) version of the test may be the one that fails to reject the null hypothesis. In less borderline situations, both tests will lead to the same conclusion. Proposals have been made in the literature for dealing with borderline situations."

To this, we proceed as follows:\n\nGenerate a set of trials with hazard ratio at interim and final, without any interim analysis stopping. The nice thing about rpact is that we can still add informationRates, i.e. we get a set of datasets that simulate trials until the prespecified maximal number of events, and these simulation datasets contain the hazard ratio estimates at the time when we have reached informationRates% of events.\nFrom these datasets we can then extract those that jump over the interim boundary and are significant at the end. Simply computing their proportion with respect to the number of simulations gives an estimate of the power.\n\n\n# generate a set of trials with HR at interim and final, without futility interim stopping\ndesign_sim &lt;- getDesignGroupSequential(informationRates = infofrac[c(1, 3)],\n                                   sided = 1, alpha = alpha / 2, \n                                   beta = beta,\n                                   typeOfDesign = \"asUser\",\n                                   userAlphaSpending = c(0, 0.025),\n                                   futilityBounds = -6)\n\nChanged type of design to 'noEarlyEfficacy'\n\nsamplesize_sim &lt;- myGetSampleSizeSurvival(design_sim)\n\nnsim &lt;- 10 ^ 4\nsimulationResult &lt;- \n  getSimulationSurvival(design_sim, \n                        lambda2 = log(2) / m1, hazardRatio = hr,\n                        dropoutRate1 = dout1, dropoutRate2 = dout2, dropoutTime = douttime,\n                        accrualTime = accrualTime, accrualIntensity = accrualIntensity,\n                        maxNumberOfSubjects = maxNumberOfSubjects,\n                        plannedEvents = as.vector(ceiling(samplesize_sim$eventsPerStage)),\n                        directionUpper = FALSE, maxNumberOfIterations = nsim,\n                        maxNumberOfRawDatasetsPerStage = 1, seed = 2)\n\n# get aggregate datasets from all simulation runs\naggregateSimulationData &lt;- getData(simulationResult)\n\n# power taking futility into account is proportion of significant trials that ran to the end\n# use MDD from initial design with efficacy interim for final analysis\nhrs_interim &lt;- subset(aggregateSimulationData, stageNumber == 1, select = \"hazardRatioEstimateLR\")\nhrs_final &lt;- subset(aggregateSimulationData, stageNumber == 2, select = \"hazardRatioEstimateLR\")\n\n# now assess power loss for the two interim boundaries we discuss\n\n# futility interim analysis informal boundary of 1\nsurvive_interim &lt;- (hrs_interim &lt;= inform_bound)\nsurvive_final &lt;- (hrs_final &lt;= samplesize$criticalValuesEffectScale[3])\nloss_inform &lt;- mean(survive_interim & survive_final)\n\n# futility interim analysis based on conditional power\nsurvive_interim &lt;- (hrs_interim &lt;= hr_int_cp)\nsurvive_final &lt;- (hrs_final &lt;= samplesize$criticalValuesEffectScale[3])\nloss_cp &lt;- mean(survive_interim & survive_final)\n\n# stopping probabilities\nsurvive_interim &lt;- (hrs_interim &lt;= sp_bound)\nsurvive_final &lt;- (hrs_final &lt;= samplesize$criticalValuesEffectScale[3])\nloss_sp &lt;- mean(survive_interim & survive_final)\n\n# power loss from beta-spending design\npl_spending &lt;- power$overallReject\n\n# generate output table\ntab_pl &lt;- data.frame(matrix(NA, ncol = 2, nrow = 4))\ncolnames(tab_pl) &lt;- c(\"boundary\", \"power\")\nrownames(tab_pl) &lt;- c(\"Design 1 (informal)\", \"Design 2 (conditional power)\", \n                      \"Design 3 (stopping probabilities)\", \"Design 4 (beta-spending)\")\ntab_pl[, 1] &lt;- round(c(inform_bound, hr_int_cp, sp_bound, NA), 2)\ntab_pl[, 2] &lt;- round(c(loss_inform, loss_cp, loss_sp, 1 - design_beta$beta), 2)\ntab_pl[tab_pl == \"NA\"] &lt;- \"\"\nkable(tab_pl)\n\n\n\n\n\nboundary\npower\n\n\n\n\nDesign 1 (informal)\n1.00\n0.78\n\n\nDesign 2 (conditional power)\n1.28\n0.80\n\n\nDesign 3 (stopping probabilities)\n0.90\n0.72\n\n\nDesign 4 (beta-spending)\nNA\n0.80"

To this, we proceed as follows:\n\nGenerate a set of trials with hazard ratio at interim and final, without any interim analysis stopping. The nice thing about rpact is that we can still add informationRates, i.e. we get a set of datasets that simulate trials until the prespecified maximal number of events, and these simulation datasets contain the hazard ratio estimates at the time when we have reached informationRates% of events.\nFrom these datasets we can then extract those that jump over the interim boundary and are significant at the end. Simply computing their proportion with respect to the number of simulations gives an estimate of the power.\n\n\n# generate a set of trials with HR at interim and final, without futility interim stopping\ndesign_sim &lt;- getDesignGroupSequential(informationRates = infofrac[c(1, 3)],\n                                   sided = 1, alpha = alpha / 2, \n                                   beta = beta,\n                                   typeOfDesign = \"asUser\",\n                                   userAlphaSpending = c(0, 0.025),\n                                   futilityBounds = -6)\n\nChanged type of design to 'noEarlyEfficacy'\n\nsamplesize_sim &lt;- myGetSampleSizeSurvival(design_sim)\n\nnsim &lt;- 10 ^ 4\nsimulationResult &lt;- \n  getSimulationSurvival(design_sim, \n                        lambda2 = log(2) / m1, hazardRatio = hr,\n                        dropoutRate1 = dout1, dropoutRate2 = dout2, dropoutTime = douttime,\n                        accrualTime = accrualTime, accrualIntensity = accrualIntensity,\n                        maxNumberOfSubjects = maxNumberOfSubjects,\n                        plannedEvents = as.vector(ceiling(samplesize_sim$eventsPerStage)),\n                        directionUpper = FALSE, maxNumberOfIterations = nsim,\n                        maxNumberOfRawDatasetsPerStage = 1, seed = 2)\n\n# get aggregate datasets from all simulation runs\naggregateSimulationData &lt;- getData(simulationResult)\n\n# power taking futility into account is proportion of significant trials that ran to the end\n# use MDD from initial design with efficacy interim for final analysis\nhrs_interim &lt;- subset(aggregateSimulationData, stageNumber == 1, select = \"hazardRatioEstimateLR\")\nhrs_final &lt;- subset(aggregateSimulationData, stageNumber == 2, select = \"hazardRatioEstimateLR\")\n\n# now assess power loss for the two interim boundaries we discuss\n\n# futility interim analysis informal boundary of 1\nsurvive_interim &lt;- (hrs_interim &lt;= inform_bound)\nsurvive_final &lt;- (hrs_final &lt;= samplesize$criticalValuesEffectScale[3])\nloss_inform &lt;- mean(survive_interim & survive_final)\n\n# futility interim analysis based on conditional power\nsurvive_interim &lt;- (hrs_interim &lt;= hr_int_cp)\nsurvive_final &lt;- (hrs_final &lt;= samplesize$criticalValuesEffectScale[3])\nloss_cp &lt;- mean(survive_interim & survive_final)\n\n# stopping probabilities\nsurvive_interim &lt;- (hrs_interim &lt;= sp_bound)\nsurvive_final &lt;- (hrs_final &lt;= samplesize$criticalValuesEffectScale[3])\nloss_sp &lt;- mean(survive_interim & survive_final)\n\n# power loss from beta-spending design\npl_spending &lt;- power$overallReject\n\n# generate output table\ntab_pl &lt;- data.frame(matrix(NA, ncol = 2, nrow = 4))\ncolnames(tab_pl) &lt;- c(\"boundary\", \"power\")\nrownames(tab_pl) &lt;- c(\"Design 1 (informal)\", \"Design 2 (conditional power)\", \n                      \"Design 3 (stopping probabilities)\", \"Design 4 (beta-spending)\")\ntab_pl[, 1] &lt;- round(c(inform_bound, hr_int_cp, sp_bound, NA), 2)\ntab_pl[, 2] &lt;- round(c(loss_inform, loss_cp, loss_sp, 1 - design_beta$beta), 2)\ntab_pl[tab_pl == \"NA\"] &lt;- \"\"\nkable(tab_pl)\n\n\n\n\n\nboundary\npower\n\n\n\n\nDesign 1 (informal)\n1.00\n0.78\n\n\nDesign 2 (conditional power)\n1.28\n0.80\n\n\nDesign 3 (stopping probabilities)\n0.90\n0.72\n\n\nDesign 4 (beta-spending)\nNA\n0.80"
