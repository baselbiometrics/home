To this end, assume \\[\n  \\hat \\theta \\sim N(\\theta, \\sqrt{4 / d_1}).\n\\] We are then interested in the probability of continuation (or stopping, simply one minus) computed as: \\[\n  P_\\theta(\\hat \\theta \\le \\theta_\\text{int}) \\ = \\ \\Phi\\left(\\frac{\\theta_\\text{int} - \\theta}{\\sqrt{4 / d_1}}\\right),\n\\] where \\(\\theta_\\text{int}\\) is an interim boundary.

To this, we proceed as follows:\n\nGenerate a set of trials with hazard ratio at interim and final, without any interim analysis stopping. The nice thing about rpact is that we can still add informationRates, i.e.Â we get a set of datasets that simulate trials until the prespecified maximal number of events, and these simulation datasets contain the hazard ratio estimates at the time when we have reached informationRates% of events.\nFrom these datasets we can then extract those that jump over the interim boundary and are significant at the end. Simply computing their proportion with respect to the number of simulations gives an estimate of the power.\n\n\n# generate a set of trials with HR at interim and final, without futility interim stopping\ndesign_sim &lt;- getDesignGroupSequential(informationRates = infofrac[c(1, 3)],\n                                   sided = 1, alpha = alpha / 2, \n                                   beta = beta,\n                                   typeOfDesign = \"asUser\",\n                                   userAlphaSpending = c(0, 0.025),\n                                   futilityBounds = -6)\n\nChanged type of design to 'noEarlyEfficacy'\n\nsamplesize_sim &lt;- myGetSampleSizeSurvival(design_sim)\n\nnsim &lt;- 10 ^ 4\nsimulationResult &lt;- \n  getSimulationSurvival(design_sim, \n                        lambda2 = log(2) / m1, hazardRatio = hr,\n                        dropoutRate1 = dout1, dropoutRate2 = dout2, dropoutTime = douttime,\n                        accrualTime = accrualTime, accrualIntensity = accrualIntensity,\n                        maxNumberOfSubjects = maxNumberOfSubjects,\n                        plannedEvents = as.vector(ceiling(samplesize_sim$eventsPerStage)),\n                        directionUpper = FALSE, maxNumberOfIterations = nsim,\n                        maxNumberOfRawDatasetsPerStage = 1, seed = 2)\n\n# get aggregate datasets from all simulation runs\naggregateSimulationData &lt;- getData(simulationResult)\n\n# power taking futility into account is proportion of significant trials that ran to the end\n# use MDD from initial design with efficacy interim for final analysis\nhrs_interim &lt;- subset(aggregateSimulationData, stageNumber == 1, select = \"hazardRatioEstimateLR\")\nhrs_final &lt;- subset(aggregateSimulationData, stageNumber == 2, select = \"hazardRatioEstimateLR\")\n\n# now assess power loss for the two interim boundaries we discuss\n\n# futility interim analysis informal boundary of 1\nsurvive_interim &lt;- (hrs_interim &lt;= inform_bound)\nsurvive_final &lt;- (hrs_final &lt;= samplesize$criticalValuesEffectScale[3])\nloss_inform &lt;- mean(survive_interim & survive_final)\n\n# futility interim analysis based on conditional power\nsurvive_interim &lt;- (hrs_interim &lt;= hr_int_cp)\nsurvive_final &lt;- (hrs_final &lt;= samplesize$criticalValuesEffectScale[3])\nloss_cp &lt;- mean(survive_interim & survive_final)\n\n# stopping probabilities\nsurvive_interim &lt;- (hrs_interim &lt;= sp_bound)\nsurvive_final &lt;- (hrs_final &lt;= samplesize$criticalValuesEffectScale[3])\nloss_sp &lt;- mean(survive_interim & survive_final)\n\n# power loss from beta-spending design\npl_spending &lt;- power$overallReject\n\n# generate output table\ntab_pl &lt;- data.frame(matrix(NA, ncol = 2, nrow = 4))\ncolnames(tab_pl) &lt;- c(\"boundary\", \"power\")\nrownames(tab_pl) &lt;- c(\"Design 1 (informal)\", \"Design 2 (conditional power)\", \n                      \"Design 3 (stopping probabilities)\", \"Design 4 (beta-spending)\")\ntab_pl[, 1] &lt;- round(c(inform_bound, hr_int_cp, sp_bound, NA), 2)\ntab_pl[, 2] &lt;- round(c(loss_inform, loss_cp, loss_sp, 1 - design_beta$beta), 2)\ntab_pl[tab_pl == \"NA\"] &lt;- \"\"\nkable(tab_pl)\n\n\n\n\n\nboundary\npower\n\n\n\n\nDesign 1 (informal)\n1.00\n0.78\n\n\nDesign 2 (conditional power)\n1.28\n0.80\n\n\nDesign 3 (stopping probabilities)\n0.90\n0.72\n\n\nDesign 4 (beta-spending)\nNA\n0.80"

To this end, assume \\[\n  \\hat \\theta \\sim N(\\theta, \\sqrt{4 / d_1}).\n\\] We are then interested in the probability of continuation (or stopping, simply one minus) computed as: \\[\n  P_\\theta(\\hat \\theta \\le \\theta_\\text{int}) \\ = \\ \\Phi\\left(\\frac{\\theta_\\text{int} - \\theta}{\\sqrt{4 / d_1}}\\right),\n\\] where \\(\\theta_\\text{int}\\) is an interim boundary.

To this, we proceed as follows:\n\nGenerate a set of trials with hazard ratio at interim and final, without any interim analysis stopping. The nice thing about rpact is that we can still add informationRates, i.e.Â we get a set of datasets that simulate trials until the prespecified maximal number of events, and these simulation datasets contain the hazard ratio estimates at the time when we have reached informationRates% of events.\nFrom these datasets we can then extract those that jump over the interim boundary and are significant at the end. Simply computing their proportion with respect to the number of simulations gives an estimate of the power.\n\n\n# generate a set of trials with HR at interim and final, without futility interim stopping\ndesign_sim &lt;- getDesignGroupSequential(informationRates = infofrac[c(1, 3)],\n                                   sided = 1, alpha = alpha / 2, \n                                   beta = beta,\n                                   typeOfDesign = \"asUser\",\n                                   userAlphaSpending = c(0, 0.025),\n                                   futilityBounds = -6)\n\nChanged type of design to 'noEarlyEfficacy'\n\nsamplesize_sim &lt;- myGetSampleSizeSurvival(design_sim)\n\nnsim &lt;- 10 ^ 4\nsimulationResult &lt;- \n  getSimulationSurvival(design_sim, \n                        lambda2 = log(2) / m1, hazardRatio = hr,\n                        dropoutRate1 = dout1, dropoutRate2 = dout2, dropoutTime = douttime,\n                        accrualTime = accrualTime, accrualIntensity = accrualIntensity,\n                        maxNumberOfSubjects = maxNumberOfSubjects,\n                        plannedEvents = as.vector(ceiling(samplesize_sim$eventsPerStage)),\n                        directionUpper = FALSE, maxNumberOfIterations = nsim,\n                        maxNumberOfRawDatasetsPerStage = 1, seed = 2)\n\n# get aggregate datasets from all simulation runs\naggregateSimulationData &lt;- getData(simulationResult)\n\n# power taking futility into account is proportion of significant trials that ran to the end\n# use MDD from initial design with efficacy interim for final analysis\nhrs_interim &lt;- subset(aggregateSimulationData, stageNumber == 1, select = \"hazardRatioEstimateLR\")\nhrs_final &lt;- subset(aggregateSimulationData, stageNumber == 2, select = \"hazardRatioEstimateLR\")\n\n# now assess power loss for the two interim boundaries we discuss\n\n# futility interim analysis informal boundary of 1\nsurvive_interim &lt;- (hrs_interim &lt;= inform_bound)\nsurvive_final &lt;- (hrs_final &lt;= samplesize$criticalValuesEffectScale[3])\nloss_inform &lt;- mean(survive_interim & survive_final)\n\n# futility interim analysis based on conditional power\nsurvive_interim &lt;- (hrs_interim &lt;= hr_int_cp)\nsurvive_final &lt;- (hrs_final &lt;= samplesize$criticalValuesEffectScale[3])\nloss_cp &lt;- mean(survive_interim & survive_final)\n\n# stopping probabilities\nsurvive_interim &lt;- (hrs_interim &lt;= sp_bound)\nsurvive_final &lt;- (hrs_final &lt;= samplesize$criticalValuesEffectScale[3])\nloss_sp &lt;- mean(survive_interim & survive_final)\n\n# power loss from beta-spending design\npl_spending &lt;- power$overallReject\n\n# generate output table\ntab_pl &lt;- data.frame(matrix(NA, ncol = 2, nrow = 4))\ncolnames(tab_pl) &lt;- c(\"boundary\", \"power\")\nrownames(tab_pl) &lt;- c(\"Design 1 (informal)\", \"Design 2 (conditional power)\", \n                      \"Design 3 (stopping probabilities)\", \"Design 4 (beta-spending)\")\ntab_pl[, 1] &lt;- round(c(inform_bound, hr_int_cp, sp_bound, NA), 2)\ntab_pl[, 2] &lt;- round(c(loss_inform, loss_cp, loss_sp, 1 - design_beta$beta), 2)\ntab_pl[tab_pl == \"NA\"] &lt;- \"\"\nkable(tab_pl)\n\n\n\n\n\nboundary\npower\n\n\n\n\nDesign 1 (informal)\n1.00\n0.78\n\n\nDesign 2 (conditional power)\n1.28\n0.80\n\n\nDesign 3 (stopping probabilities)\n0.90\n0.72\n\n\nDesign 4 (beta-spending)\nNA\n0.80"

This is caused by cutting off a greater rejection region by the futility stop (right of \\(\\alpha_0\\)) than adding to it by the efficacy stop (left of \\(\\alpha_1\\)), and by compensating for this imbalance through a higher conditional error function (\\(\\alpha_2 &gt; \\alpha\\); so-called âbuy-back alphaâ from the futility stop)."

The second stage of the trial, showing less of a treatment effect, carries greater weight in this ânaiveâ (that is, incorrect) version of the test.

In less borderline situations, both tests will lead to the same conclusion. Proposals have been made in the literature for dealing with borderline situations."

The second stage of the trial, showing less of a treatment effect, carries greater weight in this ânaiveâ (that is, incorrect) version of the test. Note that it can go both ways: in other examples, the adaptive (correct) version of the test may be the one that fails to reject the null hypothesis. In less borderline situations, both tests will lead to the same conclusion. Proposals have been made in the literature for dealing with borderline situations."

While indeed a formidable challenge in the route to change, we also experience headwinds from our own functionâwho perhaps struggle to separate seizing opportunities with debating enhancements. In other words, how can we do a better job as statisticians to show up as a united front so that our clinicians donât see methods as simply a matter of opinion?\n\n\nJonas\nLindelÃ¸v\n(1) Do you have examples of important innovations that did not reach impact?

Q1.2: Are there sometimes you would advise to go with an âoldâ method instead of trying something ânewâ out? Q2: How much extra time do you estimate that it takes to implement a new method for a study design? Q3: Is there a regulatory risk (e.g.Â longer interactions or pushback?) when using a new statistical method?\n\n\nStefan\nEnglert\nWhat measures do you take to quantify and measure impact? Which metrics are used?\n\n\nStefan\nSchandelmaier\nHello Panel. Thanks for the seminar! We (Malena Chiaborelli, Stefan Schandelmaier) are establishing a group for methods implementation at the University of Basel. We will initially focus on âwritten methods guidanceâ which we believe plays a key role in the innovation to implementation process. We would be very interested in ideas on how we can improve methods guidance to maximise its usefulness and impact.\n\n\nSusan\nEdwards\nHow do you know when a new innovationâs benefit is great enough to make up for its (likely) added complexity or at least the hurdle of its unfamiliarity?\n\n\nTu\nXu\nThe biologic innovation is of no doubt to be a must in industry environment. However, statistical innovation is often considered an optional or ânice-to-haveâ as long as regulatory requirements are met. How could we raise the importance of statistical innovation to the business and make it as a necessary part of clinical development process?\n\n\nXiaoling\nWu\nwhat is the one task statistician can do better than AI?\n\n\nXiaowei\nRen\nIs there any application of Bayesian sample size augment in the single arm trial\n\n\nYanning\nLiu\nNA\n\n\nYingwen\nDong\nWhatâs the biggest hurdle to introduce innovation in clinical development and how to overcome it?"
